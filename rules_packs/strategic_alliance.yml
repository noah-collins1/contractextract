prompt: |
  Extract grounded facts from the contract text. Use exact spans (no paraphrasing).
  Only return fields that are actually present; omit absent fields.

  Classes:
  - liability_cap(cap_text, cap_multiplier, cap_money.amount, cap_money.currency, carveouts[])
  - contract_value(value_text, amount, currency)
  - fraud_clause(fraud_text, liability_assignment)              # liability_assignment in {"other","self","unclear"}
  - governing_law(law_text, country)                            # country or clearly named jurisdiction

  Guidelines:
  - liability_cap: If the cap references "12 months of fees" or similar, set cap_multiplier=1.0.
  - contract_value: Extract the total/maximum contract value if explicitly stated (not every money mention).
  - fraud_clause: Include any fraud carveout. If text assigns liability to the "other party", set liability_assignment="other"; 
    if it assigns liability to the same party, use "self"; else "unclear".
  - governing_law: Extract the governing law/jurisdiction/venue clause and identify the country/jurisdiction string.

  Return ONLY a single JSON object with this shape (no extra text):
