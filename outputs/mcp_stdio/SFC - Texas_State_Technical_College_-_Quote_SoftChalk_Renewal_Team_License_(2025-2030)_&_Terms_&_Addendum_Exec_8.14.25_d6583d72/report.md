### 7.2 Recommendations

_The following recommendations are AI-generated and should be reviewed by legal counsel._

**For Liability Cap Present And Within Bounds:** Add a clear liability cap indicator (e.g., '12 months of fees' or an explicit monetary cap) to the contract. This can be done by inserting a sentence such as: 'The total liability under this agreement shall not exceed [insert specific amount or duration].'

**For Jurisdiction Present And Allowed:** Remove the multiple jurisdiction clauses and replace them with a single, clear clause that specifies the applicable jurisdiction (e.g., 'This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas').
